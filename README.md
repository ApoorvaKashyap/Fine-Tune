# Web Based MP3 Player

## Programming Languages Course *(BSc Programme, NRTI)*

### Professor: Amey Karkare

***Language: Python***
***Type: Mini Project***

---

The PRL course has a mini project component. A mini project will be a moderate-sized python application that performs some useful task. It has to be implemented in a team of up to five students.

### Requirements of the Project

1. The project must use a reasonable data set as input. This data set must come from a persistent storage or generated automatically by another program. Some examples example, a Web site, XL sheet, CSV file, SQL or similar database, Output generated by some process  such as a video, apache server etc. Some minor inputs (such as tuning parameters, value to search etc.) can be taken as input from the user.

2. User Interface: The application must have an easy to use user interface (UI). While a browser based UI is preferred, you can also use other options, like Tkinter. Do not spend too much time on fancy stuff though. You can explore Flask, Bottle etc.

## Chosen Project: Web Based MP3 Player

The Music Player will be developed from scratch using Python. It will be web-based, i.e., it will have a  web server which will have music stored in mp3 format. The player will search for a music track on demand and then play the music track if found. Otherwise, it will ask the user if they want to add the music track to the server.

### Functionalities

1. Play a track already stored in server.
2. Ask whether the user wants to add the track to the server, if the demanded track is unavailable.
3. Have the Play/Pause, Fast Forward and Skip Buttons.
4. Allow the creation, modification and deletion of a playlist.

### Libraries Used

1. OS - To work with directories and filesystems.
2. PyTube - To access songs from the internet.
3. URLLib - To access the html codes of webpages.
4. Re - To find the matching expressions in the search results.

` P.S. - The App is still in development.The privacy of users is not an important priority at this stage. `
